# European Parties Explorer - Sapienza Visual Analytics project

## The dataset
This project is based on the datasets provided by the [Chapel Hill Expert Surveys](https://www.chesdata.eu/ches-europe), which evaluated the European parties on many topics over the years. In particular, I used their **1999-2019 trend file** (Jolly, Seth, Ryan Bakker, Liesbet Hooghe, Gary Marks, Jonathan Polk, Jan Rovny, Marco Steenbergen, and Milada Anna Vachudova. 2022. “Chapel Hill Expert Survey Trend File, 1999-2019.” Electoral Studies. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electstud.2021.102420) and their **2024 expert survey** (Rovny, Jan, Ryan Bakker, Liesbet Hooghe, Seth Jolly, Gary Marks, Jonathan Polk, Marco Steenbergen, and Milada Vachudova. “25 Years of Political Party Positions in Europe: The Chapel Hill Expert Survey, 1999-2024,” working paper).
